## 1. Introduction

`WonderTool` is a powerful utility for calculating string strength. It is available in both JavaScript and C#. With `WonderTool`, you can:

- Determine a string's strength based on its length
- Calculate string's strength based on its character diversity

<a name="installation"></a>
## 2. Installation

### JavaScript

To install with npm: `npm install WonderTool`

Then, import the package: `const WonderTool = require("WonderTool");`

### C#

To install, add the `WonderTool.dll` to your project's references.

Then, include the namespace: `using WonderTool;`

## 3. Usage

`WonderTool` has two main methods:

- `calculateLengthStrength(str)` - Calculates the strength of a string based on its length
- `calculateDiversityStrength(str)` - Calculates the strength of a string based on its character diversity

## 4. Examples

### JavaScript

```javascript
const WonderTool = require("WonderTool");

const input = "Hello, world!";
const lengthStrength = WonderTool.calculateLengthStrength(input);
const diversityStrength = WonderTool.calculateDiversityStrength(input);

console.log(`Length strength: ${lengthStrength}`);
console.log(`Diversity strength: ${diversityStrength}`);
C#
using System;
using WonderTool;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "Hello, world!";
        int lengthStrength = WonderTool.Calculator.CalculateLengthStrength(input);
        int diversityStrength = WonderTool.Calculator.CalculateDiversityStrength(input);

        Console.WriteLine($"Length strength: {lengthStrength}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Diversity strength: {diversityStrength}");
    }
}
```
